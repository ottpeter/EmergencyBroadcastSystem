This will be most likely a React Native application.

It will have a red ALARM button, or something like this, and you will be able to see nearby Distress Signals as well.
All Distress Signals will be broadcasted across the whole system, all devices will receive the signal, but if it's too far away, it will drop it.
In some menu, it would be possible to see the far away Distress Signals as well.
If an emergency event is happening nearby, it will trigger an alarm on that phone.


Look into CoachDB / PoachDB
